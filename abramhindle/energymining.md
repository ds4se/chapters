# The Perils of Energy Mining: Measure a Bunch, Compare just Once

## A Tale of TWO HTTPs

Shaiful Chowdhury [[Chowdhury2015](#Chowdhury2015)] came into the lab
and proclaimed, "HTTP/2.0 has significantly better energy performance
than HTTP/1.1!" "That's excellent," I exclaimed, "Do you know why?"

The next week Shaiful came back to the lab and said, "I think I was
wrong, I don't think there's a difference." He went on to explain that
he was happy with the results of the first experiment but something
was bothering him.

To test HTTP/1.1 in Firefox he had to disable HTTP/2.0 in Firefox's settings,
thus his energy consumption test of Firefox for HTTP/1.1 had to do
more work than his HTTP/2.0 tests.  He investigated the CPU state of
the HTTP/2.0 and HTTP/1.1 tests and found that the rigorous button
pushing used to disable HTTP/2.0 put the CPU into a higher
state: high frequency, and more voltage.  Thus the CPU state for the
HTTP/1.1 started higher and was consuming more than the HTTP/2.0
tests.

Shaiful's solution was to inject some idle time into the HTTP/1.1
test, allowing the CPU to lower its state.  He then ensured via manual
inspection that the idling did drop down the CPU state.  Afterwards both
tests produced results that were comparable; it turns out that on a fast
network there's not much difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.0.

The entire experiment was threatened by attributing the change in
energy consumption to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.0 code in
Firefox, when in fact it was caused by our HTTP/1.1 test inducing the CPU to
have a different state than the HTTP/2.0 tests. Misattribution of the
root causes of energy consumption is just one of many perils one faces
when engaged in Green Mining, energy-aware mining, and software energy
consumption measurement.

## Let's ENERGISE your Software Energy Experiments

We want to help prevent experimental accidents when measuring the
energy consumption of software systems. The most difficult aspect of
measuring and mining software energy consumption is to juggle all of
the confounds and potential threats to validity one faces. The first 2
questions any software energy miner should ask themselves are "What do
I want to measure?" and "What am I actually measuring?". The intent is
to create a test or benchmark that will allow us to compare energy
consumption of the task or program in question.

In prior work [[Hindle2012](#Hindle2012)] we propose a methodology of
repeated measurement and comparison of such a test:

1. Choose a product and task to test;
2. Decide on granularity and level of instrumentation;
3. Choose which versions of the software to test;
4. Develop a test case for the task to be tested;
5. Configure the testbed environment to reduce background noise;
6. For each combination of version, task and configuration repeat multiple times:
   1. Setup the testbed to record energy consumption measurements;
   2. Run the test;
   3. Compile and store the recorded data;
   4. Cleanup the testbed.
7. Analyze and evaluate.

This methodology can be combined with a simple mnemonic, <a
id="ENERGISE"></a>**ENERGISE** [1](#british). ENERGISE is a
checklist of issues, built from prior
experience[[Hindle2014](#Hindle2014)], that one should consider when
measuring software energy consumption:

+ **Environment** -- prepare a stable testbed for energy measurement.
+ **N-versions** -- run a test across more than 1 version of the software.
+ **Energy or power** -- do we care about total energy consumed of a
  task or the per second cost of running a service?
+ **Repeat** -- 1 run is not enough, we need to run our tests multiple
  times to address background noise.
+ **Granularity** -- what level of measurement, how often, and what
  level of invasiveness of instrumentation?
+ **Idle** -- how do applications and service react with no load: is
  energy being wasted?
+ **Statistics** -- repeat measures call for summary statistics and
  comparing distributions.
+ **Exceptions** -- errors happen, how do we address with them or notice them?

### Environment

The environment is the testbed and the system that will run the
software under test. Environments should be representative of
realistic platforms and scenarios, yet balanced against noise such as
third-party apps or traffic, unneeded applications, or other
users. Generally environments should be as controlled as
possible. Even temperature can affect energy measurements.

### N-Versions

The first step to any successful attempt at optimization is to measure
system performance before optimization. If we are measuring software
energy consumption to determine the impact of changing the code we
should measure the system before the modification to allow for
comparison. Our work in Green Mining has shown that software does
indeed change in energy performance over time and measuring just 1
version of the software might not be representative of the versions
before or after. It is recommended that multiple versions of the
software are measured.

### Energy or Power

Energy is the cost of work or the capacity to do work, energy is
typically measured in joules (J). Power is the rate of energy
consumption, essentially the derivative of energy consumption,
measured in watts (W) where 1 watt is equal to 1 joule second.

When you measure a task that a system executes, ask your system, does
this task have a clear beginning or end? Does this task continuously
run? Tasks that do not run continuously, such as sharpening an
image or compressing a video file can be characterized by the energy
consumed. Where as a task that runs continuously, such as sharpening
video images of a surveillance web-camera or streaming video
compression, is better characterized by its workload, its power, the
rate of energy consumption.

### Repeat!

While we already recommended measuring multiple versions of software,
something even more important is to repeat your measurements.  Modern
computers are very noisy and active systems with lots of background
processes and lots of state.  They have many peripherals and services.
It is hard to guarantee what tasks are executing on a modern system
and what the current environment is like.  If you're running a test
using WIFI your own cellphone could affect the experiment.  Furthermore
we're measuring physical phenomena: energy consumption.  Our
measurement equipment, our testbeds, or energy measurement devices all
have error in them, error is inherent in physical measurement thus we
need to take multiple measurements so we can rely upon statistics to
give us a clearer picture of what we measured.

### Granularity

When designing a energy consumption test one has to choose the level
of granularity. Do you want to measure method calls, system calls, CPU
use, memory use, processes, etc. and at what frequency? Many
measurement devices and ICs, such as the Watts Up? Pro device or the
TI INA-219 IC, are sampling at thousands of times per second,
integrating the results and reporting back to you at a fraction of
that rate. If you only have 1 second of granularity from a Watts Up?
Pro you won't be measuring the cost of a method call unless you explicitly make a
benchmark that repeatedly calls it. If you need method call level
measurements, the instrumentation overhead will be high.

Granularity is a concern if you measure just a single process
or component or if you measure the whole system.  An example
scenario is if you asked the sound-card to play a sound for 1
second.  The request to play a sound might return in 1ms to the
process, for the next second the OS, the sound card driver and sound
card will be interacting, playing the requested 1 second of audio.  If
we measure at the process level we miss the induced cost on the system
of the software, the software commanded work but we are not measuring
that work.  If we measure at the entire system level we will be
including a lot of other processes and drivers that will be
irrelevant.

### Idle Measurement

Not all applications or tasks have idle behaviour, but many user
facing applications and services run continuously or intermittently in
the foreground or background. What programs do when they aren't in
direct use is important because usually their idle operation is a
often waste of resources, unless work is being executed during idle
time. An efficient process can stay asleep until it receives input.
The operating system's scheduler is very good at sleeping and waking
processes.

Idle use often characterizes baseline energy consumption for an
application is. If executing tasks and idleness use the same amount of
energy perhaps the idle components can be optimized to use less
energy. Measuring idle consumption is useful to determine what impact
changes might have on the implementation of non-functional requirements.

### Statistical Analysis

Repeat measurements cause many problems: there is no longer 1
measurement, there are many. Thus summary statistics can be employed
to describe the distribution of measurements. There is one saving
grace, energy measurements are of physical phenomena and the Normal
(or Gaussian) distribution often model the errors within natural
measurements well. Thus the variance and mean are two reasonable
descriptors of our multiple runs. This means we can use parametric
tests such as the Student's T-test to compare two distributions of
measurements to see if they are statistically significantly different.
Without statistical tools such as the T-test we would not have much
confidence to determine if distribution's were different or not based
on random chance.


### Exceptions

To err is human and to throw uncaught exceptions is to execute code.
Mobile devices and modern computers still suffer from crashing
software. Exceptions happen, core dumps occur, sometimes apps decide
to update, sometimes the network goes down, sometimes a remote site
is unavailable. Often the software under test is just inherently buggy and
only half of the test runs will complete. When developing tests one
should instrument the tests with auditing capabilities such as
screenshots to enable postmortem investigations. Furthermore
outliers should be investigated and potentially re-run.
You wouldn't want to attribute a difference in energy consumption to
an erroneous test.

## Summary

In summary, there are many confounds that one faces when measuring
software energy consumption. First and foremost, energy consumption is
a physical process and energy consumption measurement requires
repeated measurement and statistical analysis. Thus remember and use the
[ENERGISE](#ENERGISE) mnemonic to help evaluate energy measurement
scenarios: environment, N-versions, energy or power, repeated
measurement, granularity, idle measurement, statistical analysis, and
exceptions.
